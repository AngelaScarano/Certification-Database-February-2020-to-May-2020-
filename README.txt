######## USER GUIDE ########
To successfully run this application, you will need the Certification database designed by Angela Scarano installed - much of
this code relies on information that is specific to that databases labeling and design. It is designed to be installed in MySQL
software.

The entire application can all be run inside of Jupyter notebook once everything is installed! As long as you have downloaded 
the proper database, Jupyter Notebook, and the associated Jupyter Notebook file, you can run it!

You do not need to know SQL to use the application - the python interface is pre-coded with SQL statements and will only ask
you for the information you want entered when it needs input. Much of this application is NOT guarded for incorrect entries 
though - please be careful when submitting or deleting entries! 

To run this application, run the second cell in the jupyter notebook python file first (this is where many helper functions are
located), THEN run the third cell, which contains the primary backbone and the remaining pieces of the application. This application 
has pre-recorded queries that you may select from, as well as the option to add and remove entries to the various tables in the database.

A copy of this user guide is located in the jupyter notebook python file of the interface application itself, in the first cell.
